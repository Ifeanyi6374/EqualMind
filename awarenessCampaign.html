            <h1>Some Campaigns</h1>
            <h2>Education For All</h2>
            <p class="desc">Education For All was a global initiative launched by UNESCO in 1990 to ensure quality basic education for everyone, especially marginalized groups. Its focus areas included universal primary education, gender equality, adult literacy, and improved education quality. Although the official EFA movement concluded in 2015, its goals continue under the broader UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4).<a href="https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/education-all">Learn More</a></p>
            <h2>Global Partnership for Education</h2>
            <p class="desc">GPE is a multilateral funding platform that supports education in low-income countries. It partners with governments, donors, and civil society to strengthen national education systems. GPE provides grants, technical support, and policy guidance to improve equity, quality, and accessâ€”especially for girls and children in crisis-affected areas.<a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/">Learn More</a></p>
            <h2>Education Cannot Wait</h2>
            <p class="desc">Education Cannot Wait is a global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. Launched in 2016, it delivers rapid-response funding and multi-year investments to ensure children in conflict zones, disasters, and displacement situations can access safe, quality education. It targets the most vulnerable, including refugees, girls, and children with disabilities.
